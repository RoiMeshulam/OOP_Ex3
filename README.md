# What is this project?

This project is a Graph analayzing project which allows us to insert graphs, create graphs, changing graphs and study them.

# The way we made our project:

We have made a few classes these next lines will explain them.

Node/Edge- are 2 low-key classes that know how to do the most basic functions.(Creating nodes/edges/getting their location values etc..)

DiGraph - this class is represting a graph = (V=group of vertexes,E=group of edges) and all the functions we can do on a graph(adding and removing edges/nodes, getting Iterators of the graph edges/nodes and more)

GraphAlgo - this class allows us to make alogrithems on graphs such as tsp(getting cities),calculating shortest path(through dijkstra algorithm), checking if a graph is connected(BFS on same vertes on a graph&the graph's opposite),Using matplotlib to show a graphic visual of the graph and more.

# How did we test our project?
In every step and every function we made we did all the tests on the extreme conditions of the graph to make sure that our graph can handle all possible situations.
In addition there are 2 testing classes

# Graph stability:

Regular graphs (from the examples) - all algorithms take not more than ~ 1 second

1000 Nodes - Show graph takes ~ 10 seconds, algroithms are taking more than 30 minutes

10000 Nodes - Show graph takes ~ 1 minutes

# How to use our project:

You can simply run the examples from the main (the checks())

# Comparing to java:

A0 - 11 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0|0.015|0
Python|0|0.156|0

A1 - 17 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0|0|0
Python|0|0.031|0

A2 - 31 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0.016|0.016|0
Python|0.015|0.140|0.031

A3 - 49 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0.015|0.032|0.031
Python|0.015|0.578|0.031

A4 - 40 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0.015|0.032|0.031
Python|0|0.312|0.031

A5 - 48 Nodes

Language | shortestPath | center | TSP
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Java|0.000|0.063|0.016
Python|0.015|0.5310|0.031

We can obviously see Java runing time is way faster than Python.

All the outputs of our functions were checked and verified as true answers

Hope you find good usuage of this project!
